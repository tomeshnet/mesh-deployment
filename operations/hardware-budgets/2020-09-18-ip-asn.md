# 2020-09-18 IP and ASN Budget for Toronto Community Network

## Purpose

Allows for public IPs routing inside the mesh, TorIX peering, and multiple exit nodes support.
Please refer to issue [#20](https://github.com/tomeshnet/toronto-community-network/issues/20).

## Background Context

This proposal involves [Hypha](https://hypha.coop) becoming a collaborator of the project through becoming a member of ARIN, acquiring an ASN and the IP blocks, and lease them to Toronto Mesh at cost to operate, as ARIN membership requires a legal entity.

Under this arrangement, Hypha has agreed to:

- Hypha will become an ARIN member (must be a legal entity)
- Hypha will have an Autonomous System (AS) with an Autonomous System Number (ASN)
- Toronto Mesh will lease the AS (and its IP addresses) from Hypha (Hypha still owns it, but Toronto Mesh operates it)
- IPv4 timeline is approximately a 4 month waiting list, IPv6 immediately

The full cost of the first year, excluding labour, will be covered by Toronto Mesh:

- ARIN membership: USD 550 initial membership fee
- IP blocks: USD 500 per year total for two IP blocks

Cost to Hypha:

- Estimated 20 hours of upfront admin work, and 20 hours each year
- No technical work

Hypha does not commit to covering IP or labour costs beyond the first year.
The expectation is that ongoing IP costs will continue to be covered by Toronto Mesh, and there will not be any labour cost.

Since @asotnetworks, @darkdrgn2k, and @benhylau are all members of Hypha, this grant needs approval from @TimTor and @Shrinks99 in their grant administrator capacity.
